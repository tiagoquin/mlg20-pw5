## Practical work 05 - Unsupervised Learning

> Use Self-Organized Maps (SOM) and K-Means as a means for clustering and visualization purposes using a collection of images. 

## Point 2. Clustering of wine data 

> Apply the K-means algorithm to the wine database. Use the 13 features of wine to find clusters in the data. a) Set K=3 and run K-means, 10 times each time, and b) given that you already know the type of wine for each observation, compute the average number (based on your 10 runs) of the number of observations that are correctly grouped together for each type of wine. Comment your results

## Point 3. Clustering of images application 

> We will provide you with a database of color images, a set of three feature extraction methods and a SOM library. You may setup diverse experiments with the database, which contains a lot of classes. You should apply the three feature extraction methods and observe the results, and you have to modify the configuration and learning parameters of the SOM algorithm
